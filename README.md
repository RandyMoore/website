# Website (what a creative name!)
Everything needed to deploy my personal website (content persisted in DB not included).  Flask based app wrapped in Dockerized Nginx.

## Setup
###Flask Debug Mode
Create a python virtual environment at the project root:  
`virtualenv .`  
This will allow installation of the app's dependencies in the project directory they do not mess with your global Python environment.  

Install the application  
`cd app`  
`pip install --editable .`  
The "editable" is so that when you deploy the app in debug mode it automatically reloads when you make code or resource changes - very fast development iteration.  To run in debug mode and have the site accessible at localhost:5000  
`./run_debug.sh`

Running the app in debug mode should always be done first to create the blog database app/blog.db  For a currently unknown reason running the app using nginx will result in a SQLAlchemy error complaining it can't find blog.db, but if it already exists all is well.

###Nginx
First create blog.db - run the app in Flask Debug Mode as above.  You will also need to have Docker installed on your machine.  From the project root  
`docker-compose up`  
A single Docker container will be created with Nginx using uWSGI to communicate with the application via a socket.

## WIP
Yes this is a work in progress.  There's some code duplication, things need to be cleaned up, etc.  At this point using docker-compose is overkill since there's only one container - but that will probably change in the future :)
